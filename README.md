# e-commerce-site-for-games
This project is an e-commerce site for games. For the backend, I implemented it using Python and Flask. All the backend files are organized within the "Model" folder. Additionally, I placed the binary files containing the data in a subfolder named "data" inside the "Model" folder.

On the other hand, for the frontend side, I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. To maintain a well-structured project, I stored all the frontend files in the "View" folder.

By separating the backend and frontend components into distinct folders, it becomes easier to manage and maintain the project. This structure allows for clear separation of concerns, enabling efficient development and future updates.
